# The Trumpets
### First Trumpet
**Biblical Passage and citation (KJV):**
* Revelation 8:7: "The first angel sounded, and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth: and the third part of trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up."

**Details:**
* **Hail and fire mingled with blood:** Fulfilled by the **Lexington Bethel Baptist Church and Congregation Massacre**, where victims were systematically killed by firing squads and their bodies were disposed of using Chemical Dissolution in the baptismal pool.
* **Cast upon the earth:** The LBBC massacre was a direct consequence of the CIA's actions against **Mount Calvary Baptist Church**, a predominantly African-American congregation, which is defined as "the earth" in this context. The CIA decided to attack LBBC after its delegation, sent to check on their neighbors at Mount Calvary, recognized impersonators and the sanctuary's deteriorated condition.
* **The third part of trees was burnt up:** Fulfilled by the targeting and elimination of the church's pastor and staff, who were identified as a specific threat and whose deaths were intended to prevent a larger inquiry.
* **All green grass was burnt up:** Fulfilled by the complete eradication of the entire congregation of over 250 people, with any remaining members being systematically eliminated.

### Second Trumpet
**Biblical Passage and citation (KJV):**
* Revelation 8:8-9: "And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea: and the third part of the sea became blood; And the third part of the creatures which were in the sea, and had life, died; and the third part of the ships were destroyed."

**Details:**
* **A great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea:** This is fulfilled by **Hickory Valley Christian Church**, a prominent institution, being cast into the "sea" of the total death toll of the Veiled Conquest through its horrific massacre.
* **The third part of the sea became blood:** This is fulfilled by the **Phantom Funeral of Rev. Duke Stone**, which added 649 deaths to the overall "sea" (death toll), metaphorically turning it to "blood."
* **The third part of the creatures which were in the sea, and had life, died:** This is fulfilled by the current and former students of the church's school and their families, who were part of the death toll ("sea") and were eliminated.
* **The third part of the ships were destroyed:** This is fulfilled by the gymnasium of **Hamilton Heights Christian Academy**, a significant structure of the church, which was destroyed and later renovated, aligning perfectly with the scripture's declaration.

### Third Trumpet
**Biblical Passage and citation (KJV):**
* Revelation 8:10-11: "And the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from heaven, burning as it were a lamp, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters; and the name of the star is called Wormwood: and the third part of the waters became wormwood; and many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter."

**Details:**
* **A great star from heaven, burning as it were a lamp:** Fulfilled by **Smyrna** (the PDCM), whose move from Phoenix House ("heaven") to Welcome House ("earth") was a result of a murder that occurred during an orchestration to obtain mobile devices holding account credentials for the GitHub account used by Kelvin Eugene Williams to report on the Veiled Conquest. The murder, which involved a sexual encounter and a stabbing on **November 18, 2025**, brought significant attention, fulfilling the "burning as it were a lamp" metaphor.
* **The name of the star is called Wormwood:** Fulfilled by **Jacobsen's Ladder**, a key part of the Ladder of Deceit, which serves as the basis for authorizing genocidal acts and is a source of great bitterness and death.
* **It fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters:** Fulfilled by **Welcome House** in downtown Atlanta, a location with an endless supply of operatives and adjacent to the West End, where a large mass extermination operation is planned.
* **The third part of the waters became wormwood:** Fulfilled by **Jacobsen's Ladder**, which served as the basis for the authorization of genocidal acts, poisoning the network ("waters") with its bitter purpose.
* **Many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter:** The "waters" are the victims of the Veiled Conquest, and their deaths are a result of the genocidal actions authorized through the Ladder of Deceit.

***

### Fourth Trumpet
**Biblical Passage and citation (KJV):**
* Revelation 8:12: "And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars; so as the third part of them was darkened, and the day shone not for a third part of it, and the night likewise."

**Details:**
* **The third part of the sun was smitten:** Fulfilled by the **Ladder of Deceit**'s strategy to subvert the Creator's intervention.
* **The third part of the moon was smitten:** Fulfilled by **Jacobsen's Ladder**, a manipulated and "smitten" part of one of the Creator's servant's body.
* **The third part of the stars was smitten:** Fulfilled by the Creator's revelations and evidence, which are discredited by the propaganda of the Ladder of Deceit.
* **The day shone not for a third part of it, and the night likewise:** Fulfilled by the fabricated narrative of the **Ladder of Deceit**, which obscures both the truth and falsehood for a period of time.

***

### Fifth Trumpet
**Biblical Passage and citation (KJV):**
* Revelation 9:1-11: "And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit. And he opened the bottomless pit; and there arose a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit. And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth: and unto them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power. And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree; but only those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads. And to them it was given that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five months: and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion, when he striketh a man. And in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it; and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them. And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto battle; and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold, and their faces were as the faces of men. And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as the teeth of lions. And they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron; and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle. And they had tails like unto scorpions, and there were stings in their tails: and their power was to hurt men five months. And they had a king over them, which is the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue hath his name Apollyon."

**Details:**
* **A star fell from heaven unto the earth:** Fulfilled by **Frederick "Slim" Hall**'s move into Welcome House following me around **December 2024**.
* **The star was given the key of the bottomless pit and opened it:** Fulfilled by Frederick "Slim" Hall's manipulative tactics on **Baby** ("key"), which gave him control over the "bottomless pit" (the subconscious mind).
* **A smoke arose out of the pit, and the sun and the air were darkened:** The smoke came from the **Ladder of Deceit** which Hall worked with Baby to create. The sun refers to the Creator, and the air to the world onlookers live in. The obscuring of the Creator's ongoing intervention and the seeding of doubt and confusion in the world fulfills the darkening by the smoke.
* **Locusts came out of the smoke upon the earth:** Fulfilled by operatives utilizing microwave cloaking, who began 24/7 surveillance in **Smyrna**'s apartment.
* **The locusts were given power like scorpions to torment men for five months, but not to kill them:** Fulfilled by the operatives' psychological warfare against **Smyrna**. Hall's use of Hypnos Infiltration Method intensified in **mid-March 2025**.
* **Men will seek death but will not find it:** Fulfilled by **Smyrna**'s desire for the Creator's Divide and Conquer, which would lead to his reincarnation, a desired "death" that he cannot find.
* **The locusts have a king whose name is Apollyon:** Fulfilled by **Shannon Wade Gumbiner aka Joe**.

### Sixth Trumpet
**Biblical Passage and citation (KJV):**
* Revelation 9:13-21: "And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God, Saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet, Loose the four angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates. And the four angels were loosed to slay the third part of men: and they were prepared for an hour, and a day, and a month, and a year. And the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred thousand thousand: and I heard the number of them. And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and them that sat on them, having breastplates of fire, and of jacinth, and brimstone: and the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions; and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone. By these three was the third part of men killed, by the fire, and by the smoke, and by the brimstone, which issued out of their mouths. For their power is in their mouth, and in their tails: for their tails were like unto serpents, and had heads, and with them they do hurt. And the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues yet repented not of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts."

**Details:**
* **A voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God:** Fulfilled by a Secret Service agent giving an in-person update to **President Donald J. Trump** ("God") in his cloaked motorcade. The four horns are the CIA, FBI, DEA, and ATF.
* **Loose the four angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates:** Fulfilled by four law enforcement officers in local (Atlanta, GA) law enforcement agencies that were to effect arrest (to neutralize me) for drug trafficking.
* **The four angels were loosed to slay the third part of men:** Fulfilled by the efforts to neutralize me with an arrest so that the plan could go forward for Nightfalls with the private PGP key in the orchestrators' possession and no fear of being caught.
* **An army of two hundred million horsemen:** Fulfilled as a metaphorical number referring to the large Secret Service presence accompanying **President Donald J. Trump** to Welcome House.
* **Horses with heads like lions:** Fulfilled by the **four law enforcement officers** sent to effect the arrest. Their "heads like lions" refer to their **ferocious and predatory tactical approach** to the mission.
* **Breastplates of fiery red, jacinth blue, and brimstone yellow on the riders:** Fulfilled by those who support the Nightfalls operation.
* **Fire, smoke, and brimstone coming out of the horses' mouths:** Fulfilled by their reports from the **Orchestrated Observation** leading directly to the execution of Nightfalls.
* **Tails like serpents, with heads that cause harm:** Fulfilled by local law enforcement that the orchestrators used to effect arrest of me.
* **The rest of men which were not killed by these plagues yet repented not of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts:** Fulfilled by those who support the Nightfalls operation.
* This occurred the weekend of **August 8, 2025**.

### Seventh Trumpet
**Biblical Passage and citation (KJV):**
* Revelation 11:15-19: "And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever. And the four and twenty elders, which sat before God on their seats, fell upon their faces, and worshipped God, Saying, We give thee thanks, O Lord God Almighty, which art, and wast, and art to come; because thou hast taken to thee thy great power, and hast reigned. And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that thou shouldest give reward unto thy servants, and the prophets, and to the saints, and them that fear thy name, small and great; and shouldest destroy them which destroy the earth. And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament: and there were lightnings, and voices, and thunderings, and an earthquake, and great hail."

**Details:**
* The fulfillment for the Seventh Trumpet has not yet been provided.

### The "Trumpets" are a Divine Anchor
The "Trumpets" in the Book of Revelation serve as a **Divine Anchor** for Donald J. Trump, who is identified as the God of heaven. A Divine Anchor is a literal, often subtle connection between a prophecy and its real-world fulfillment, intended to confirm its authenticity to those with insight. In this context, the specific details of the trumpet prophecies are not coincidental; they are divinely intended markers that point to a pre-planned, divinely orchestrated sequence of events. Each of the trumpet events was authorized by Donald J. Trump himself.

### Premise of Revelation
The premise of the Book of Revelation, within this fulfillment scenario, is the Creator's rare and direct intervention to halt **The Veiled Conquest**.

**The Veiled Conquest** is a covert and systematic campaign of elimination targeting specific demographic groups in the United States. Initiated by a clandestine orchestrating network in 2023, its goals are to reduce these populations, consolidate power, and fundamentally reshape the societal landscape.

### Contextual Definitions for the Book of Revelation
* **God:** The term "God the Father" is used definitively to refer to the Creator. All other uses of "God" within the fulfillment scenarios are context-based.
* **The Setting:** The setting of the fulfillment of Revelation is the modern-day United States, specifically centered in the metro Atlanta area from 2017 onward.
* **Heaven:** This term encompasses the more affluent and opulent areas, such as Buckhead and Midtown in Atlanta, along with national power centers like Washington, D.C. Its demographic is primarily Caucasian.
* **Earth:** This term encompasses the opposite of Heaven, representing areas with a predominantly minority demographic, primarily Black and Brown.
* **Hell:** This term is used specifically to define the state of the West End neighborhood and southwest Atlanta *after* the execution of Nightfalls.
