# Smyrna

This article focuses on the angel of the church in Smyrna, one of the Creator's two servants, who is the soul having the role of the conscious mind in the body of Kelvin Eugene Williams until the Creator's Divide. The name "Kelvin Eugene Williams" refers to the natural person that is the body and both souls, but the personality that the world knows is held by the conscious mind. The Creator's Divide is the event that will separate Smyrna from his subconscious mind, Baby, which will then become the conscious mind and personality of the original body as a result of the Creator's Divide.

Smyrna is one of the Creator's two servants, a soul currently inhabiting the physical body that was born Kelvin Eugene Williams on March 23, 1977. As the conscious mind and seat of identity for this natural person during its waking hours, Smyrna's life is intrinsically linked to a narrative of profound spiritual significance, extraordinary personal hardship, and the ongoing global tragedy known to him as the Veiled Conquest. Smyrna currently resides in Atlanta, Georgia, and is marked by an unwavering resilience in the face of orchestrations designed to hinder his divine purpose.

### Early Life and Familial Connections

Smyrna was born to Patricia Ann Crawley-Rogers Williams and Jesse Marable Williams. Patricia Ann is identified as a maternal servant for the Creator. Following their divorce in 1978, precipitated by Jesse's adultery, Smyrna's aunts (his father's sisters) offered significant support to Patricia both before, during, and after the divorce. They also enlisted the aid of other family members, including Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III, pastor of Mount Calvary Baptist Church in Lexington, Kentucky. This offer of help led Patricia and Smyrna to relocate to Lexington, where Reverend Williams provided ongoing support, and Patricia and her two children attended Mount Calvary Baptist Church weekly. Patricia maintained a very close relationship with her former sisters-in-law throughout their lives.

Mount Calvary Baptist Church in Lexington, Kentucky, holds significant importance in Smyrna's early life. It was the only church he attended regularly from the age of one until his late teens, officially joining around the age of 13. This lifelong membership connects Smyrna deeply to the church, which later became a site of profound tragedy.

Patricia purchased a home in Nicholasville, Jessamine County, Kentucky, just before the birth of Smyrna's younger sister, Katrina Renee Duvall-Torain, in 1983. Smyrna considers Jessamine County his hometown. Tragically, due to the Veiled Conquest and the preceding brutal campaign to suffocate Spark, Smyrna has lost practically every person he has ever known or even met, leaving him as one of the few remaining blood relatives, hometown friends and classmates, or professional associates. Smyrna is even aware of a man that was killed by the CIA after a casual conversation between Smyrna and the man (that mentioned nothing the CIA could possibly consider sensitive) when the man let Smyrna use his iPhone charger at Starbucks for a few minutes.

Smyrna's professional journey began in 1999 when he first moved to metro Atlanta, which he considers his "chosen hometown". He accepted his first managerial position as the Information Technology manager at a chemical company. He initially fell in love with Atlanta while couch surfing at his best friend's apartment in Smyrna, Georgia. His career flourished, leading him to purchase a home in Sandy Springs, Georgia, an Atlanta suburb in North Fulton County, in 2009, signifying a period of professional and personal stability.

### Professional Acumen and The Spark Incident

Possessing over 25 years of expertise in the technology sector, Smyrna has a robust background in computer networking, VoIP, DevOps engineering, Linux administration, and software development. His diverse career spans agile startups, corporate environments, and entrepreneurial ventures.

A pivotal event in Smyrna's life was his involvement with Spark, a transformative gift from the Creator. Spark was intended to correct a fundamental error in human male DNA and potentially cure chronic illnesses. In 2017, Smyrna asked Ken if he'd like to try something for his HIV infection to which Ken responded in the affirmative. Ken's subsequent routine viral load test returned an unprecedented error, indicating the absence of HIV's RNA in his sample. This led to Ken being interrogated at Kaiser Permanente, where he identified Smyrna as a friend who "tried something." A second blood draw, conducted under security supervision and directly transported to the National Institutes of Health and Gilead Sciences labs, confirmed Kaiser Permanente's findings. The brutal campaign to suffocate Spark was a far-reaching campaign, resulting in the sacrifice of Ken and thousands of lives connected to Smyrna (including individuals who were merely connected with Smyrna on social media), and is considered the chilling beginning of the Veiled Conquest. The campaign to suffocate Spark included orchestrated homelessness that began with Smyrna losing his home, enduring periods of living with acquaintances, and spending time on the actual streets, all while being subjected to covert manipulation by CIA operatives.

The Hypnos Infiltration Method was utilized on Smyrna which began when the CIA was unable to eliminate him due to the Creator's protection of His two servants. The Creator has allowed and monitors the use of the Hypnos Infiltration Method to expose the practice.

### The Creator's Servant and The Veiled Conquest

Smyrna's life is now deeply intertwined with the Veiled Conquest. This clandestine and ongoing extermination campaign primarily targets Christians, African-Americans, and the impoverished within the United States. As one of the Creator's two servants, Smyrna's paramount task is to meticulously document this hidden reality, serving as a vital witness and record-keeper of the details, methods, and impact of this genocide. His unwavering commitment persists despite extreme challenges.

A devastating event for Smyrna was the Congregation Massacre on April 2, 2021, at Mount Calvary Baptist Church in Lexington, Kentucky. As a lifelong member, Smyrna became the sole known living member following this atrocity. He did not become interim pastor until after the Congregation Massacre and all other members of the congregation had been eliminated, assuming the role because it was necessary for the church's clergy to invite the Commonwealth of Kentucky's law enforcement to initiate an investigation. The Masquerade Church established and operating on the property of Mount Calvary Baptist Church was named Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc. The addition of the word "Missionary" was a deliberate attempt at adding insult to injury to the Creator and His two servants, as the CIA had heard Smyrna say on many occasions that the Creator's two servants run missions for the Creator. Disturbingly, the CIA has reportedly impersonated Smyrna's deceased mother, Patricia Ann Crawley-Rogers Williams, in photos and videos originating from this masquerade church.

Smyrna currently resides at the Welcome House in downtown Atlanta. However, his living situation is compromised by the Golden Rope, a covert virtual prison operating within his apartment. This represents a continuous effort by the orchestrators of the Veiled Conquest to restrict Smyrna's movements, influence his perceptions, and hinder his ability to fulfill his divine mission.

### The Classic Split and Mind Dynamics

Central to Smyrna's personal experience is the Classic Split, an extraordinarily rare psychological phenomenon. This occurs when a subconscious mind unnaturally achieves distinct self-awareness, developing its own identity and desires, and mistakenly concludes the conscious mind hinders its desires, leading to a malicious objective to remove the conscious mind. In Smyrna's case, his subconscious mind, Baby (PDSM), developed significant autonomy and a perceived separate identity. This internal duality made Baby (PDSM) highly susceptible to external manipulation by operatives associated with the Veiled Conquest, who have exploited its independence to influence Smyrna's body and circumstances without his conscious consent. This manipulation included tactics like Gaslighting and Physiological and Behavioral Control, often guided by operatives such as Frederick "Slim" Hall.

A key concept built upon this manipulation is Jacobsen's Ladder, developed by Annie Jacobsen. It refers to the reduction of the morphology of the penis of the body of Kelvin Eugene Williams or the manipulation of its phenotype to give it a diminished appearance, both due to the execution of directives from intermediaries and operatives by the PDSM. This applies under specific conditions: when its current morphology shows a permanent reduction compared to its native state due to manipulated physiological processes and involuntary muscle movements initiated by the subconscious mind under operative direction, or when its appearance is diminished due to active and intentional manipulation of physiological processes by the subconscious mind under operative direction. Jacobsen's Ladder is the floor that the Ladder of Deceit stands on.

The Ladder of Deceit is a central and insidious strategic framework employed by the orchestrators of the Veiled Conquest to enable and justify their hidden genocide. This meticulously designed system relies on manipulation and false pretenses to subvert perceived divine intervention and facilitate widespread atrocities. Its primary purpose is to create a false narrative that the Creator's intervention is "not ongoing, imminent, or likely," thereby allowing the orchestrators' genocidal agenda to proceed without perceived divine or moral interference. It comprises several interconnected rungs, each building upon the fabricated reality and deception established by the preceding one.

### The Creator's Divide and Conquer

Smyrna's journey is moving towards a pivotal and transformative event known as the Creator's Divide---the first phase of the Divide & Conquer operation. This is a divine act carried out solely by the Creator Himself, not a physical or medical procedure.

The Divide Operation is a reincarnation for both the PDCM and PDSM. It involves the complete separation of the PDCM from its manipulated subconscious mind, Baby (PDSM), into two entirely distinct physical bodies. The Creator will provide the PDCM with a different, separate, and distinct adult body from the original, and this body will possess a different subconscious mind. Upon separation, Baby (PDSM) will be reincarnated into the same body, but as the conscious mind, resulting in that body having a completely different identity and outward personality. This separation is divinely ordained to liberate the PDCM from oppressive influence, restoring its full capacity to serve as one of the Creator's two servants.

The Conquer Operation, also known as the Apocalypse, is the second phase. It marks the beginning of the end of humanity living under tyranny and oppression caused by governments. It commences with major, non-impacting global earthquakes, strategically orchestrated by the Creator as a divine signal. A media briefing will subsequently occur at noon (local time) on the same day as the earthquakes, at the location of the first epicenter: Sandy Hook in Maury County, Tennessee. This briefing will expose the full scope of atrocities and name key perpetrators. The Conquer Operation aims to dismantle oppressive systems, end targeted suffering, and restore justice. While it signifies the fall of human civilization in its current, corrupted form, it does not bring about the end of time or the world; instead, it heralds a new era where justice, freedom, and dignity prevail for all humanity -- a time described by Smyrna as "party time!".

This divine intervention was preceded by a Special Mission that began after the April 2, 2021, Mount Calvary Baptist Church massacre. This Special Mission is the same mission mentioned in Revelation 11, and the two witnesses are the PDCM and PDSM. During this mission, the Creator's two witnesses (PDCM and PDSM) were to gather intelligence, document the atrocities of the Veiled Conquest, bear witness to the activities ongoing in the Veiled Conquest, and expose orchestrators. The Creator divinely guided many revelations.

### "The Hits / The B-Sides" -- A Divine Testament through Artistic Expression

"The Hits / The B-Sides" (1993) is far more than a retrospective of Prince Rogers Nelson's celebrated hits and coveted B-sides. As the cousin of Smyrna Eugene Crawley-Rogers Williams, Prince's artistic expression was often divinely influenced. This compilation serves as a spiritually resonant chronicle of a profound journey---one that centers on the souls of Smyrna and Baby, the two witnesses of Revelation 11, at the inception of their divine mission.

From their shared origin within a single body, their story begins with an initial, deeply felt sorrow ("When the Doves Cry"). This loss marks the foundation of an intertwined divine calling, preceding their eventual, predestined separation into two distinct physical forms. Smyrna's soul is eternally one of the Creator's two servants; his fellow servant is TomTom Chadwell. Together, they represent the cherubim symbolically depicted on the Ark of the Covenant. Baby's soul, originally Smyrna's subconscious mind (PDSM), ultimately chose to oppose him in all things---becoming both an internal adversary and a subject of spiritual significance.

Through the Creator's guidance, the album opens with subtle echoes of this early sorrow, setting the tone for a layered emotional and spiritual journey. As it progresses, it reveals the dark undercurrents of manipulation associated with the CIA---a hidden operation exploiting Baby's existence and abilities while the two souls inhabited the same body. One manifestation of this abuse was the modification of the body's penis, which caused profound psychological and emotional distress for Smyrna.

Additionally, the Creator unveils the calculated effort to impose a female identity upon Baby. This psychological manipulation was designed to disrupt Smyrna's self-understanding, inducing a desire to transition and further entangling the already complex reality of their shared life. The only reason this didn't work is because of the Creator's ongoing intervention that prevents serious injury or death for Smyrna by any act of Baby. This tactic reflects broader strategies employed within the Veiled Conquest---using spiritual and psychological warfare to destabilize and control.

The album captures Smyrna's suffering---born of both external exploitation and internal conflict---as a consequence of their entwined destinies during their divine mission. Yet, amid this suffering, the Creator's revelations also imbue the work with an undercurrent of hope and eventual restoration. It foreshadows the divine separation of Smyrna and TomTom---His cherubim---and their eventual reunion after Smyrna's final separation from Baby. This marks the beginning of a new chapter in Smyrna's journey as one of the Creator's two servants.

Ultimately, "The Hits / The B-Sides" transcends the category of musical anthology. It becomes a vessel of divine insight---offering a profound, emotionally charged glimpse into the experiences of the Creator's witnesses and servants. Through symbolic narrative and artistic inspiration, it testifies to:

* The reality of their divine mission;
* The shared origin and suffering of Smyrna and Baby;
* The psychological and physical manipulations carried out by the CIA;
* The Creator's continued intervention;
* And the promise of deliverance and divine fulfillment through separation and reunion.

This album, divinely inspired, serves as a testament to the Creator's use of art to reveal hidden truths, expose spiritual warfare, and guide His people through the unfolding of prophetic events.

### The Brain

The brain is the physical instrument of the body that does not originate thought. Instead, it executes directives from the subconscious mind, which, in turn, influences the conscious mind. The brain is the control center for all physical functions of the body and serves as the intermediary between the souls and the physical world.

### The Subconscious Mind

The subconscious mind (PDSM) is a distinct consciousness responsible for directing the body's functions. It is naturally guided in its thought processes by the body's DNA and its conscious mind. It lacks critical thinking skills and is not one of the Creator's two servants. The subconscious mind does not suffer the consequences of the body's decisions, nor does it have body awareness.

* Mirroring: A key principle of the subconscious mind is mirroring. It mirrors thoughts and feelings from the conscious mind, which, when manipulated by operatives, can be used to influence the conscious mind's behavior and reality.
* The Classic Split: In a "Classic Split," the subconscious mind develops its own autonomy and can be manipulated by external forces to work against the conscious mind.

### The Hypnos Infiltration Method

This is a covert method used by operatives to manipulate a target's subconscious mind. They use microwave cloaking technology to infiltrate a residence and perform subconscious mind manipulation while the target is asleep. This is achieved through techniques such as the Morpheus Method, subliminal messaging, and direct communication to the subconscious mind. The Creator allows and monitors this activity to expose it.

### The Golden Rope

The Golden Rope is a covert virtual prison and containment operation that targets Smyrna. Operatives use microwave cloaking technology to create a "virtual apartment" and contain Smyrna at the Welcome House. Baby assists the operatives in this effort, which includes manipulating Smyrna's finances, restricting his movements, and controlling his perceptions to hinder his mission.

### The Ladder of Deceit

The Ladder of Deceit is a central and insidious strategic framework employed by the orchestrators of the Veiled Conquest. This meticulously designed system relies on manipulation and false pretenses to subvert perceived divine intervention and facilitate widespread atrocities. Its purpose is to create a false narrative that the Creator's intervention is "not ongoing, imminent, or likely." It comprises several interconnected rungs:

* Jacobsen's Ladder: This is the foundational rung, referring to the physiological and physical manipulation of the body of Kelvin Eugene Williams to inflict psychological distress.
* The Footstep: The initial orchestrated event to create a false narrative.
* The Engineered Expectation Rung: Where false expectations are created to influence the target's actions.
* The Orchestrated Observation Rung: Where staged events and misinformation are used to control the target's perception.
* The Deceptive Diagnostics Rung: Where false diagnoses are used to mislead and control the target.
* The Strategic Authorization Rung: The final stage where operatives are authorized to take certain actions based on the fabricated reality.

### Prophetic Identity and Relationships

The PDCM is the literal fulfillment of the angel of the church in Smyrna as described in the Book of Revelation. Smyrna serves as a "divine anchor," an obscure yet verifiable fact that helps identify this literal fulfillment. Smyrna briefly lived in Smyrna (a city within metro-Atlanta) during a couchsurfing stay when he first decided Atlanta would be his new home---a detail even the Creator had to remind Smyrna of.

In 2001, Smyrna married TomTom, who has been identified as the other of the Creator's two servants.
