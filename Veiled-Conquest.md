# Veiled Conquest

Veiled Conquest is a clandestine and systemic operation, representing the fulfillment of biblical prophecy as described in the Book of Revelation (KJV). It is unfolding entirely within the United States, constituting a multifaceted campaign of control and eradication designed to dismantle societal structures and eliminate specific populations. This insidious campaign is orchestrated by a network of high-ranking current and former elected officials and personnel from the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).

Primary Targeted Groups

* Christians
* African Americans
* The impoverished

Other Affected Groups

* Convicted criminals
* Military opposition
* Political opposition
* Endowed males
* Individuals

## The Seven Seals

The Seven Seals represent a precise chronology of prophetic events unfolding within the Veiled Conquest, meticulously mirroring the divine narrative detailed in the Book of Revelation (KJV). Each seal marks the opening of a new phase in the campaign, characterized by specific orchestrators, events, and targets. This sequence of seals provides the overarching prophetic framework for the clandestine and systemic acts of conquest, war, famine, and death being executed by the orchestrators.

* First Seal (White Horse): Conquest with Underlying Pestilence

* Rider: Donald J. Trump.
* Opened: November 3, 2020.
* Details: Conquest Element began with Trump's re-election loss and his subsequent vow to return to power, a situation manipulated by Annie Jacobsen, a senior CIA operative and Trump's drug supplier. This signifies the initial establishment of control and influence, laying the groundwork for subsequent operations. The "Underlying Pestilence Element" is described as the CIA's orchestrated introduction of HIV into humans.

* Second Seal (Red Horse): War

* Rider: Annie Jacobsen.
* Opened: April 2, 2023.
* Details: This seal was opened when "Hurricane Annie" Jacobsen launched a surprise assault on Mount Calvary Baptist Church (an African-American congregation and the lifelong church of one of the Creator's two servants) in Lexington, Kentucky on April 2, 2023, that left those attending the Sunday morning service dead. After the surprise assault, members and their families not attending were identified and eliminated. This was the first of seven Congregation Massacres which targeted and eliminated both African-American and Caucasian congregations. Phantom Funerals were later used to lure in associates and family of the victims, and this mechanism evolved to target high-value individuals such as military and political opposition, and endowed males.

* Third Seal (Black Horse): Famine

* Rider: Annie Jacobsen.
* Opened: August 30, 2024.
* Details: This seal was opened after the first Phantom Pantry operation held by a Masquerade Church. Phantom Pantry operations are a mass killing disguised as charitable food assistance to lure the impoverished from the community surrounding a Masquerade Church.

* Fourth Seal (Pale Horse): Death

* Rider: Michael Blackmon, a senior CIA operative.
* Opened: September 2024.
* Details: This seal was opened when plans were finalized and authorized by both Presidents Biden and Trump for the mass extermination of residents and visitors of southwest Atlanta (overwhelmingly African-American demographic) via an aerial bombing. The Final Authorization was dependent upon a metaphorical Litmus Test designed to always indicate "no ongoing, imminent or likely intervention by the Creator," the test's engineered results were largely due to the manipulative tactics of Frederick "Slim" Hall that exploited the inherent weaknesses of the subconscious mind when Hall targeted Baby, the subconscious mind of Kelvin Eugene Williams, and developed a fictional image and romantic relationship with Baby that it considered legitimate to gain its trust and loyalty to exploit Baby's abilities as the subconscious mind.

* Fifth Seal: Cry for the martyrs

* Opened: December 27, 2024.
* Details: This seal was opened due to the repeated use of the Emergency Services Interruption Tactic (ESIT) which is a denial of 911 emergency services for victims at mass killings by the CIA.

* Sixth Seal: Cosmic upheavals

* Opened: March 13-14, 2025.
* Details: Celestial events and societal shifts.

* Seventh Seal: Silence

* Opened: TBD

## Spark

Spark is a gift from the Creator designed to correct a fundamental error in human male DNA and potentially cure chronic illnesses. It removes an instruction from nuclear DNA that keeps the immune system dormant, allowing the correct instructions in the mitochondrial DNA to activate it. This activation causes the immune system to immediately eliminate any contagion, such as viruses, and promises a disease-free human race. What modern medicine and science consider a fully functional immune system, the Creator considers a "fail safe". The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) perceived Spark as a threat, which led to a campaign to "suffocate Spark" starting in late 2017. This campaign is considered the beginning of the Veiled Conquest.

One of the Creator's two servants, Kelvin Eugene Williams, facilitated the first known instance of Spark being administered in the spring of 2017. He offered an experimental treatment to a man named Ken, who had been HIV positive for nearly a decade. After receiving Spark, Ken's HIV infection fully disappeared. A routine viral load test returned with a "target not found" error, indicating the absence of HIV's RNA in his blood. Ken was subsequently interrogated at Kaiser Permanente in the fall of 2017, where he identified Kelvin. A second blood draw was taken under security supervision and sent to the National Institutes of Health and Gilead Sciences labs, which also found no HIV RNA.

After confirming the disappearance of HIV, the CIA eliminated Ken and attempted to eliminate Kelvin. When these attempts failed, the CIA launched a brutal campaign to "suffocate Spark" by eliminating anyone who may have heard of it or supported Kelvin. The campaign resulted in the elimination of thousands of people connected to Kelvin, including blood relatives, friends, and acquaintances. The CIA also began manipulating Kelvin's subconscious mind while he slept, orchestrated his homelessness, prevented him from earning an income, and engaged in various forms of psychological warfare, including gaslighting, torment, and manipulation of his body, specifically his penis. The Hypnos Infiltration Method was used on Kelvin after Spark's effectiveness was proven.

## Operations

This section provides a detailed exposition of the primary mechanisms employed within Veiled Conquest, a clandestine and systemic operation functioning within the United States. This multifaceted campaign is designed to achieve totalitarian control through the systematic and unrecorded elimination of specific populations. Characterized by its meticulous planning, profound deception, and ruthless efficiency, the operational framework ensures that targeted individuals are not merely killed but effectively erased from existence, presenting as if they have simply "absconded" from their societal roles. Central to this abhorrent initiative are the Congregation Massacre, the Phantom Funeral, and the Phantom Pantry. These operations are frequently interconnected, leveraging repurposed ecclesiastical structures, termed "Masquerade Churches," as primary logistical centers, and are inherently linked to the illicit financial enrichment of the orchestrators through the clandestine Phantom Identity Scheme.

This exposition will introduce each of these mechanisms and provide an in-depth analysis of their operational methodology.

### Congregation Massacre

The Congregation Massacre is a chilling and meticulously executed operation within The Veiled Conquest, a covert and systematic campaign. Designed by Hurricane Annie Jacobsen based on tactics detailed in her book Surprise, Kill, Vanish, its primary objective is the elimination of Christian congregations, followed by the thorough concealment of their disappearance. This operation exclusively targets Christian communities, with Jacobsen personally leading the first assault on Mount Calvary Baptist Church.

Targeted Group(s):

* Christians

#### Operational Methodology

* Management: Hurricane Annie Jacobsen personally plans and manages each massacre, ensuring the consistent application of its brutal protocols.
* Timing of Assaults: The assaults on congregations are strategically timed to occur during the primary weekly worship service, often specifically during the sermon when the congregation is most gathered and attentive.
* Emergency Services Interruption Tactic: As the assault begins, calls to 911 are intercepted and redirected to accomplice call takers who pretend to be 911 dispatchers and promise help is on the way, effectively preventing any legitimate emergency response.
* Method of Execution: Victims are killed using a chainsaw, the weapon personally ordered by Hurricane Annie Jacobsen, which prevents fatigue among operatives, thereby ensuring maximum efficiency in the killing process.
* Disposal and Concealment: The core goal is for victims to "merely disappear," preventing discovery and investigations by local and state authorities. Following the killings, the bodies are disposed of using Chemical Dissolution. This process involves adding powdered chemicals to water, typically within church baptismals, to dissolve multiple bodies at once, leaving behind only pulverized bone fragments. The portability and discretion of Chemical Dissolution make it an ideal method for large-scale, concealed disposal.
* Direct Killings: Members of the congregation not present during the massacre are identified and subsequently eliminated to ensure complete eradication.
* Post-Massacre Repurposing: After a massacre is completed, the targeted churches are not abandoned. Instead, they are repurposed and renovated into Masquerade Churches, serving as fronts to further mask the atrocities and maintain an illusion of normalcy.

#### Congregation Massacres

The following table documents the known Congregation Massacres:

| | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Congregation/Church | Location | Date | Victims |
| Mount Calvary Baptist Church | Lexington, Kentucky | April 2, 2023 | 127 |

| Calvary Baptist Church | Lexington, Kentucky | May 12, 2024 | > 400 |
| Hickory Valley Christian Church | Chattanooga, Tennessee | May 12, 2024 | > 1,000 |

### Phantom Funeral

Within the abhorrent campaign of systematic elimination known as Veiled Conquest, Phantom Funerals function as a sophisticated and profoundly deceptive tactical instrument. These events are not genuine expressions of bereavement, but rather mass executions meticulously disguised as legitimate funeral or memorial services engineered to lure and eliminate individuals deemed a threat or possessing strategic value by the orchestrators.

Targeted Group(s):

* Christians (first)
* Individuals
* Military opposition
* Political opposition
* Endowed males

#### Purpose and Evolution

Initially, Phantom Funerals were conceived with a critical and insidious purpose directly linked to Congregation Massacres, serving as a follow-up mechanism designed to:

* Narrative Control: By presenting a seemingly legitimate occasion for mourning, Phantom Funerals aimed to control the public narrative surrounding the sudden and inexplicable absence of entire congregations, rationalizing their disappearance within the public sphere.
* Mitigation of Inquiry: By drawing in associates, friends, and family members of the massacre victims, these events established controlled environments where these individuals could be covertly eliminated. This minimized the risk of external parties discovering the true fate of the congregations or initiating effective investigations.

Subsequently, the demonstrated efficacy of Phantom Funerals as a deceptive lure prompted the orchestrators to expand their application. This evolution allowed for the systematic elimination of specific, high-value individuals or smaller groups identified as threats or strategically significant, including military personnel, political figures, and endowed males.

#### Operational Methodology

* Scheduling: The determination of event timing and scheduling is entirely at the discretion of the orchestrators, enabling precise control over target acquisition.
* Timing: Services are strategically timed to align with typical funeral or memorial service schedules, exploiting established social norms and public expectations associated with solemn remembrance.
* Site: The primary operational base for Phantom Funerals is the Masquerade Church, a renovated ecclesiastical property previously subjected to a Congregation Massacre. Additionally, the orchestrators have secured control over at least one funeral home, which is utilized on an almost daily basis for memorial and visitation services that mimic the operational characteristics of a Phantom Funeral. These controlled sites, whether repurposed churches or dedicated funeral homes, are selected for their deceptive appearance as legitimate mourning venues and their complete operational control by the orchestrators.
* Emergency Services Interruption Tactic (ESIT): The Emergency Services Interruption Tactic (ESIT) is activated concurrently with the commencement of the operation. This protocol involves the interception and rerouting of all 911 calls originating from mobile phones within an approximate 0.5-mile radius of the site. These redirected communications are subsequently handled by complicit call takers, thereby circumventing legitimate emergency response protocols and effectively precluding any external intervention.
* Method of Execution: The primary method of execution employed is decapitation by chainsaw, administered by an assigned executioner. This specific technique, chosen for its efficiency in ensuring the absence of survivors, aligns with the methodology prescribed by Senior CIA Operative "Hurricane Annie" (Annie Jacobsen) in her work Surprise, Kill, Vanish.
* Disposal and Concealment: Subsequent to execution, the corporeal remains are subjected to chemical dissolution. This process involves the introduction of powdered chemical agents into water, typically within a church baptismal font. This method effectively dissolves multiple bodies, yielding only skeletal remains. These residual bones are then meticulously pulverized utilizing a rock crusher or grinder, producing fragments that resemble common roadside gravel, ensuring complete and untraceable disposal.
* Total Elimination: The operational objective is absolute: every single mourner confirmed to be in attendance at a Phantom Funeral is eliminated. Individuals are covertly removed and disposed of without leaving any public trace.
* Concealment and Obfuscation: The operation employs a sophisticated strategy for concealment and obfuscation, integrating several distinct protocols designed to evade detection by local authorities and mitigate....

### Phantom Pantry

Phantom Pantry operations are a mechanism of mass killing employed within Veiled Conquest, disguised as charitable food assistance. The primary purpose is to lure specific populations into a Masquerade Church or another controlled location under the pretext of receiving aid, where they are subsequently eliminated.

Targeted Group(s):

* The impoverished

### Targeted Elimination of Individuals

Targeted Elimination of Individuals is a systematic and highly selective mechanism within Veiled Conquest designed for the elimination of a specific person. The protocol ensures that the individual is eliminated discreetly and their disappearance is thoroughly concealed, often utilizing the Phantom Identity Scheme to create the illusion that they are still alive.

Targeted Group(s):

* Individuals

#### Purpose and Evolution

Initially, targeted eliminations were done as part of the campaign to suffocate Spark beginning with associates of the Creator's two servants. They were then used to:

* Ensure the complete eradication of a congregation following a Congregation Massacre.
* Prevent discussion or discovery of other operations (Congregation Massacre, Phantom Funeral, Phantom Pantry).
* Eliminate individuals who are a perceived threat to the Veiled Conquest.

#### Operational Methodology

* Management: The operation is managed by a network of high-ranking operatives within the CIA, with planning and execution often delegated based on the target's significance.
* Timing: The timing is ad-hoc, determined by the opportune moment to neutralize a specific target, and can be executed at any time and in any location.
* Site: The operation can be executed at a variety of locations, including a target's home, workplace, or a public place.
* Method of Execution: Various methods are employed to ensure a swift and discreet execution, and are chosen to leave minimal to no evidence.
* Disposal and Concealment: The corporeal remains are subjected to chemical dissolution, which effectively dissolves the body, leaving behind only pulverized bone fragments. For victims killed at home, the victim's bathtub is used for the process. This ensures complete and untraceable disposal.
* Total Elimination: The objective is absolute: the targeted individual is eliminated, and everyone in the house at the time is also killed to ensure their disappearance is concealed.
* Concealment and Obfuscation: The operation employs a sophisticated strategy for concealment and obfuscation, including the use of the Phantom Identity Scheme to create the illusion that the individual is still alive.

## Concealment Protocols

To ensure the success and secrecy of this massive, horrifying undertaking, the orchestrators rely on a suite of highly sophisticated and covert tactics. Among the most critical of these are the Emergency Services Interruption Tactic (ESIT), Chemical Dissolution, and the Phantom Identity Scheme. These methods are essential for preventing external interference, concealing the true scale of the atrocities, and ensuring the absolute control and impunity of those behind Veiled Conquest.

### Emergency Services Interruption Tactic (ESIT)

The Emergency Services Interruption Tactic (ESIT) represents a highly sophisticated and multifaceted operational methodology exclusively employed by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) within the framework of Veiled Conquest. Its primary objective is to establish and maintain absolute control over emergency communication channels during sensitive covert operations. ESIT constitutes a critical and omnipresent component, integrated into every orchestration conducted throughout Veiled Conquest, serving to ensure operational secrecy, preclude external intervention, and meticulously manage local emergency response systems.

#### Core Components

* Covert Cell on Wheels (CoW): A mobile cellular base station meticulously disguised within a standard vehicle, typically a Ford Explorer. These units are deployed covertly within proximity to designated operational sites.
* Memorandum for Local Dispatch Procedures Diversion: This component entails the issuance of official directives (memoranda) to Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs). These directives explicitly instruct PSAPs to reroute emergency calls originating from specific affected geographical areas to designated law enforcement agencies or entities responsible for issuing the memorandum.
* Selective Router Tampering: This constitutes a highly technical component involving the clandestine modification of routing configurations within existing telecommunications infrastructure.
* Call Takers: These are designated operatives who possess full awareness of the ongoing orchestration or operation and are responsible for answering the 911 calls that have been redirected through the aforementioned ESIT components.

#### Operational Execution

* Timing: Covert CoWs are activated prior to the arrival of operatives at an operational site, initiating the immediate interception of mobile communications as operations commence. Memoranda for dispatch diversion and selective router tampering become concurrently effective upon the operation's initiation and remain active until specific notification is received from the coordinating agencies involved.
* Operational Area: While CoWs primarily ensure interception within a minimum 0.5-mile radius, routing adjustments facilitated by memoranda and selective router tampering are capable of affecting entire designated geographical areas, thereby ensuring comprehensive communication control for any given orchestration.
* Coordination: The memoranda component specifically ensures that PSAPs route all calls to the issuing agency. This agency then orchestrates any necessary responses (or, more commonly, the deliberate absence thereof) in conjunction with local authorities, thereby maintaining a deceptive facade of legitimate control over the emergency response.

#### Strategic Impact and Outcome

* Manipulation of Emergency Responses: ESIT effectively thwarts any local intervention, allowing covert operations to proceed unhindered by genuine emergency service responses, which are either delayed or entirely prevented.
* Ensured Operational Secrecy: By establishing comprehensive control over all emergency communication channels, ESIT rigorously maintains strict operational secrecy, preventing any compromise or exposure of the orchestrators' activities.
* Prevention of Organized Resistance: Victims are deliberately prevented from recognizing that their emergency calls are not reaching authentic emergency services. This critical deception effectively hinders any attempts at organized defense, escape, or coordinated resistance from those affected.
* Operative Safety: ESIT significantly enhances the safety of the operatives involved by shielding them from immediate threats posed by potential victims or from rapid, legitimate law enforcement responses that would otherwise occur.

### Chemical Dissolution

Chemical Dissolution is a body disposal method utilized during The Veiled Conquest, a covert and systematic campaign aimed at the mass extermination of targeted groups. This method involves using a powdered chemical, mixed with water, to dissolve human remains, leaving behind only pulverized bone fragments. Information regarding this process has been revealed as part of the Creator's intervention to bring truth to light, raise public awareness, and hold perpetrators accountable.

#### Core Components

* Powdered Chemical: The chemical is easily transportable in an oversized backpack.
* Water: Ordinary tap water, accessible from any standard faucet.
* Water-filled Structure: A common bathtub or church baptismal is used.
* Bone Processing Tool: A rock crusher or grinder is used to pulverize remaining bone fragments.

#### Operational Execution

The process begins with the preparation of a potent alkaline solution by mixing the powdered chemical with water in a water-filled structure. Up to three full-sized adult bodies are then submerged, initiating a rapid dissolution of all soft tissues within hours. The process is passive, requiring no external energy or heat. After dissolution, the remaining brittle and soft bones are crushed into a fine powder or gravel-like substance. Finally, the sterile and non-toxic liquid byproduct is safely drained into a plumbing system. A temporary odor similar to bleach or pool shock is emitted but dissipates quickly.

#### Strategic Impact and Outcome

Chemical dissolution is a key tool in Veiled Conquest due to its simplicity, portability, and efficiency. The method is straightforward, requiring minimal expertise and resources. The ease of transporting the powdered chemicals in a backpack allows perpetrators to operate discreetly and swiftly. It leaves minimal evidence, as dissolved tissues and pulverized bones are easily disposed of without a lasting trace. The speed of the dissolution process, coupled with the ability to handle multiple bodies at once, ensures high efficiency in concealing victim deaths and maintaining secrecy.

### Phantom Identity Scheme

The Phantom Identity Scheme is a covert operation developed and exclusively employed by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Its primary function is to create and maintain the illusion that individuals who have been killed are still alive, through the manipulation of public and digital records. This scheme actively covers up the deaths of targeted individuals, allowing their identities to be continuously used for operational purposes. A significant, additional objective of the Phantom Identity Scheme is the financial enrichment of the CIA itself, as well as the orchestrators, perpetrators, and other operatives involved in these clandestine activities.

#### Core Components

* Digital Presence Manipulation: Creating and sustaining a false digital footprint for a deceased individual.
* Financial Activity Manipulation: Continuing financial transactions under the deceased's name to feign financial activity.
* Altered Public Records: Updating public and legal documents to falsely indicate continued activity.
* Impersonation: Deploying impersonators in real-world interactions for significant individuals to add another layer of deception.

#### Operational Execution

The scheme operates at two levels, depending on the victim's significance. A false digital footprint is sustained through automated social media posts and email correspondence. Financial activity is maintained through continued banking transactions and the maintenance of employment records and payroll. Official records, such as tax filings and legal documents, are systematically manipulated. Communication is simulated using sophisticated methods, including AI-generated text responses based on the victim's prior conversations and voice simulation technology to conduct phone calls. The CIA obtains the victim's phone and may transfer the number to a controlled line. Cutting-edge technologies like AI and deepfakes are leveraged to produce new video or audio recordings of the victim.

#### Strategic Impact and Outcome

The Phantom Identity Scheme is extensively deployed within Veiled Conquest to conceal the true scale of the killings and ensure operations proceed without public detection. By maintaining the illusion that victims are alive, the CIA is able to obscure the death toll. The scheme also serves to monitor and eliminate individuals who might expose the truth, such as family members and friends. These eliminations guarantee secrecy. A critical outcome of the scheme is the financial enrichment of the CIA and its operatives, who exploit the financial resources of the deceased for operational funding or personal gain, thereby ensuring their ability to continue their work with financial impunity.

## Concepts

### Masquerade Church

A Masquerade Church is a clandestine operational concept within the broader framework of The Veiled Conquest, specifically employed as a Concealment Protocol after a Congregation Massacre (Red Horse: War phase). These entities are not legitimate religious institutions but rather highly deceptive fronts designed to facilitate the hidden genocidal agenda.

#### Operational Characteristics

Masquerade Churches operate on the property of a church that has suffered a Congregation Massacre, where its original congregation has been eliminated. These sites are repurposed to serve the orchestrators' objectives.

#### Purpose and Function

The primary purposes and functions of a Masquerade Church are to:

1. Lure New Victims: By appearing as legitimate places of worship, they hold mock services to attract unsuspecting individuals under the guise of religious gatherings or community events, thereby luring in new victims for elimination.
2. Obscure Operations: They operate to obscure or hide the evidence and scale of the preceding Congregation Massacre. By maintaining an illusion of normalcy, they prevent external scrutiny and detection of the systematic targeting.
3. Facilitate Reusable Execution Sites: They turn the church property into a reusable site for ongoing mass executions.
4. Host Other Operations: They often host other "Veiled Conquest" mechanisms, including:

* Phantom Funeral operations.
* Phantom Pantry operations.
* These are conducted in addition to holding mock services, typically on Sundays. Everyone who visits a Masquerade Church is ultimately eliminated.

#### Staffing and Deception

Masquerade Churches are staffed by highly trained operatives. They may use the exact same name as the original church that suffered the Congregation Massacre, and they always lean heavily on the original church's established history and standing in the community. This exploitation of inherent trust in religious institutions means the Masquerade Church is generally trusted by American citizens simply because it presents as a church on established church property. To enhance their deceptive authenticity, they may also employ actors who closely resemble the original clergy or key members of the previously eliminated congregation. This tactic ensures that the illusion of a functioning, legitimate church is maintained, further aiding in the luring of victims and the concealment of the underlying atrocities.

#### Known Masquerades

* Mount Calvary Baptist Church (Masquerade: Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc.)
* Mount Zion Baptist Church
* Hickory Valley Christian Church

#### Context within The Veiled Conquest

Masquerade Churches are a chilling example of the sophisticated and deceptive tactics employed across The Veiled Conquest, a systematic campaign of elimination targeting specific demographic groups in the United States. Their existence underscores the depth of infiltration and manipulation utilized by the orchestrators to carry out their agenda of population reduction, power consolidation, and societal reshaping.

## Key Operations

### Nightfalls (Mass Extermination)

Nightfalls refers to a meticulously planned, highly coordinated false flag operation poised to inflict catastrophic devastation upon southwest Atlanta, Georgia. It is the largest and deadliest orchestration within the broader context of The Veiled Conquest, a covert and systemic campaign of elimination targeting specific demographic groups in the United States. This event is not an act of external aggression but is orchestrated by a clandestine network of current and former high-ranking elected officials and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) personnel, with Donald J. Trump having formally authorized the operation. The name "Nightfalls" is derived from a lyric in Prince's song "Sign O the Times": "But if a night falls and a bomb falls, will anybody see the dawn?" which reflects the operation's intended deception and its devastating impact.

Objectives:

* To eliminate one or both of the Creator's two servants in order to prevent their media briefing revealing the ongoing hidden genocide in the United States and the Creator's divine intervention (The Apocalypse). The briefing, which would expose Donald J. Trump and his associates as the primary orchestrators of the Veiled Conquest, will be the focal point of the Creator's intervention. The orchestrators of this conspiracy seek to eliminate the threat posed by the Creator's servants, thereby preventing the truth from reaching the public and solidifying an authoritarian regime under Donald J. Trump, who will be installed as supreme leader of the United States.
* To enrich the primary players and their associates through a high capital ruse that capitalizes on the reconstruction efforts following the MOAB detonation. The reconstruction of southwest Atlanta and surrounding areas will provide lucrative contracts and opportunities for corruption, kickbacks, and political favors. These financial gains will be used to further the agendas of the orchestrators and entrench their power in the aftermath of the attack.
* The mass elimination of African Americans and the impoverished, who make up the majority of the population in southwest Atlanta, is a central goal of the Veiled Conquest. The MOAB detonation will result in the immediate deaths of thousands of residents, and those who survive will face severe displacement, economic hardship, and long-term social consequences. This ethnic and socioeconomic cleansing serves as a key tactic in the broader effort to eradicate marginalized communities and reshape the demographic and political landscape to the benefit of the orchestrators, who aim to secure a more compliant and consolidated political base.

Modus Operandi:

* The core of the operation involves the detonation of a GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast (MOAB) munition via airburst over the densely populated West End neighborhood in Atlanta.
* This airburst detonation is specifically chosen to maximize the radius of destruction and the lethal effects of the blast.
* Establishment of a militarized perimeter to prevent survivor escape, block humanitarian aid, and prevent media.
* Manufacture and report fake hazardous conditions.

Target:

* West End Neighborhood of southwest Atlanta, Georgia

Targeted Group(s):

* African Americans
* The impoverished

Casualties:

* Immediate - 7,000

Execution Scheduling:

* August 6, 2025 at 10:30pm
