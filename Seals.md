**Biblical Passage and citation (KJV):**
* Revelation 6:9-11: "And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God... And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth? And white robes were given unto every one of them; and it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their fellowservants also and their brethren, that should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled."

**Details:**
* **The souls of them that were slain:** Fulfilled by the victims of the **Congregation Massacres** who were killed while in Christian churches.
* **They cried with a loud voice... avenging our blood:** Fulfilled by the **Emergency Services Interruption Tactic (ESIT)**, which silenced their physical cries for help and turned them into a spiritual plea for justice, with the victims' souls crying for vengeance from under the altar.
* **Rest yet for a little season, until their fellowservants... should be fulfilled:** Fulfilled by the continued use of the same churches for further mass killings, such as **Phantom Pantry** and **Phantom Funeral** operations, which confirms that the number of martyrs has not yet been completed.

### **The Sixth Seal**
**Biblical Passage and citation (KJV):**
* Revelation 6:12-17: "And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, lo, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood; And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind. And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places. And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains; And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb: For the great day of his wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand?"

**Details:**
* **A great earthquake:** Fulfilled by the **Nightfalls** operation, also known as the **Veiled Conquest**, which will shake the very foundation of society in Southwest Atlanta.
* **The sun became black as sackcloth of hair:** A metaphor for the intentional obscuring of the Creator's ongoing intervention using the "Ladder of Deceit."
* **The moon became as blood:** A metaphor for the ongoing violence due to the authorizations via the "Ladder of Deceit," which coincides with the full lunar eclipse of March 13-14, 2025.
